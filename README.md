# Self Assessment: Array Methods

This exercise is meant to help you indentify any potential weak spots in your knowledge on array methods. Use your knowledge of `find` `filter` and `map` to implement functions according to the specifications and make the tests pass.

## Getting Started

1. Open your terminal and `cd` to your workspace directory  
1. Clone this project
1. Once the project is cloned, `cd Arrays-Exercise`
1. From the root of the project, run
   ```
   npm install
   ```
1. Take a look at the data in `src/data/classroom.js` to get familiar with the `students` and `instructors` arrays
1. Implement the functions that are specified in `src/filterExercises.js` `src/findExercises.js` and `src/mapExercises.js`
1. To test your functions, run `npm test` from the root of the project
1. Every test that you get to pass, make a commit and push it to github

> NOTE: These exercises are meant to assess your knowledge of `map`, `filter`, and `find`. Many of the tests will not pass if you don't use the correct method, so please avoid using `for` loops
